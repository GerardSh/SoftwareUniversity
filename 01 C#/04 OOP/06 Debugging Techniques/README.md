# General
В Debug -> Windows са ни предоставени всички функционалности за дебъгване. Трябва програмата да работи в дебъг режим, за да имаме видимост към всички опции за инспектиране на кода. 

Debug -> Windows -> Breakpoints - показва всички налични breakpoints. От там възможност да се експортират в xml file и да се дадат на някой друг, който има същия проект.

По време на дебъг режим, може да преместваме с drag and drop стрелката назад, ако сме пропуснали нещо.
## Conditions
Десен бутон върху breakpoint-a може да слагаме условия, кога да се активира. Примерно вътре в for цикъл, може да сложим breakpoint с condition определена стойност на i.
## Actions
Изпълнява дадено действие, примерно да изпише текст в Output прозореца.
## Labels
Може да слагаме labels на breakpoints.
## Remote debugging
Копираме адреса на web приложението и го въвеждаме в VS -> Debug -> Attach to Process
## Shortcuts
По време на дебъгване, имаме няколко възможности за придвижване напред.

Ако сме на даден метод:
Step Into (F11) - влиза вътре в него. С F11 може да стартираме дебъг режим и без да сме сложили breakpoints.
Step Over (F10) - изпълнява метода и дебъгване-то продължава без да влиза в неговия код. 

Ако имаме повече от един breakpoint може да ползваме Step Out(Shift + F11) - директно отива на другия breakpoint.
## Autos / Locals / Watch
Автоматични прозорци, показващи променливите.
Locals - показва всички променливи в даден метод.
Autos - показва променливите, които най-вероятно ни интересуват в дадения момент.
Watch - може да добавим само променливите, които ни интересуват. Може да имаме до 4 такива прозорци.. 
## Registers
Debug -> Windows -> Registers - показва регистрите в компютъра за тези променливи.
## Immediate Window
Тестване на промени в променливите: Може да тестваме как промените в дадена променлива ще повлияят на програмата. Например, може да добавим стойност към променлива и да видим незабавния резултат.

Оценяване на изрази: Може да оценяваме изрази, за да проверим техните стойности или да видим резултата от операциите.

Изпълнение на команди: Може да изпълняваме команди и методи и да виждаме резултатите в реално време.
## Data Tips
Може да pin-нем дадена променлива или обект на екрана. Може да бъдат експорт-вани.
## Threads and Stacks
Кода ни може да работи на повече от един thread, а всеки thread има свой stack.
## Call Stack
Когато се извикват методите, те се събират в стека и когато си свършат работата се махат.

Debugging in C# is a critical skill for developers, allowing them to identify and fix errors in their code efficiently. Here are some key aspects and tools related to C# debugging:
### Key Aspects of C# Debugging
1. **Breakpoints**:
    - **Definition**: A breakpoint is a marker you set in your code that tells the debugger to pause execution at that specific line.
    - **Usage**: You can add a breakpoint by clicking on the left margin next to the line number in your code editor.
    - **Conditional Breakpoints**: These are breakpoints that only trigger when a specified condition is met, allowing you to focus on specific scenarios.
2. **Step Operations**:
    - **Step Into (F11)**: Moves the debugger into the function call at the current line, allowing you to debug inside the function.
    - **Step Over (F10)**: Executes the current line and moves to the next line, skipping over function calls.
    - **Step Out (Shift+F11)**: Runs the rest of the current function and pauses execution when it returns to the calling function.
3. **Watch Windows**:
    - **Watch Window**: Allows you to monitor the values of variables as you step through your code.
    - **Immediate Window**: Lets you evaluate expressions, execute statements, and print variable values at runtime.
4. **Call Stack**:
    - **Definition**: The call stack window displays the order of method calls that led to the current execution point.
    - **Usage**: Helps trace the sequence of method calls and understand the path your code has taken to reach a certain point.
5. **Locals and Autos Windows**:
    - **Locals Window**: Displays variables that are in the current scope.
    - **Autos Window**: Automatically shows variables and their values based on the current execution context.
6. **Exception Handling**:
    - **Try-Catch Blocks**: Encapsulate code that might throw an exception in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.
    - **Exception Settings**: Configure the debugger to break on specific exceptions to identify problematic code segments.

Debugging in C# involves identifying and resolving issues or bugs in the code. Here are some common debugging techniques and tools used in C# development:
### 1. **Using Visual Studio Debugger**
- **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints in your code where you want the execution to pause. This allows you to inspect variables and the state of the application at specific points.
- **Step Through Code**:
    - **Step Into (F11)**: Move into the method or function call to see what happens inside.
    - **Step Over (F10)**: Execute the function call without stepping into it.
    - **Step Out (Shift+F11)**: Exit the current function and return to the calling code.
- **Watch Windows**: Add variables to the Watch window to monitor their values as you step through your code.
- **Immediate Window**: Execute commands and evaluate expressions during debugging to test out code snippets or check values.
- **Call Stack**: View the sequence of method calls that led to the current point of execution, which helps in understanding the flow of the program.
- **Locals and Autos Windows**: Inspect variables local to the current scope and automatically tracked variables.
- **Conditional Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints that activate only when a specified condition is true, useful for isolating issues in loops or recurring function calls.
### 2. **Logging and Tracing**
- **Logging Frameworks**: Use logging libraries like NLog, log4net, or Serilog to log information to files, databases, or other destinations. This helps track the application's behavior over time.
- **Trace Class**: Utilize the `System.Diagnostics.Trace` class to output debug and trace information. This can be controlled using configuration settings.
### 3. **Unit Testing**
- **Test Frameworks**: Write unit tests using frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit. Running tests can help identify issues and ensure code correctness.
- **Test Explorer**: Use Visual Studio’s Test Explorer to run and debug unit tests.
### 4. **Analyzing Exceptions**
- **Exception Handling**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and log relevant information. Ensure that exceptions are not swallowed silently.
- **Exception Settings**: Configure Visual Studio to break on thrown or unhandled exceptions to investigate the state of the application when an exception occurs.
### 5. **Remote Debugging**
- **Remote Debugging Tools**: Use Visual Studio’s remote debugging tools to debug applications running on a different machine or environment.
### 6. **Memory and Performance Profiling**
- **Profilers**: Use performance profilers like the one built into Visual Studio or tools like dotTrace, ANTS Performance Profiler, and PerfView to analyze memory usage, CPU usage, and performance bottlenecks.
- **Memory Dump Analysis**: Capture and analyze memory dumps to investigate memory leaks and other memory-related issues.
### 7. **Static Code Analysis**
- **Code Analysis Tools**: Use tools like SonarQube, ReSharper, or Visual Studio’s built-in code analysis to identify potential issues and improve code quality.
### 8. **Interactive Debugging with LINQPad**
- **LINQPad**: Utilize LINQPad to interactively test LINQ queries, C# code snippets, and explore data without needing to create a full project.
### Best Practices for Debugging
- **Reproduce the Issue**: Ensure you can consistently reproduce the bug before attempting to fix it.
- **Simplify the Problem**: Isolate the code that causes the issue by commenting out or disabling other parts of the application.
- **Understand the Code**: Ensure you understand the functionality and purpose of the code you are debugging.
